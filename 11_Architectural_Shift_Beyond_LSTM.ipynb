    "## Transition: From Recurrent Memory to Relational Sequence Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we analyzed LSTMs through a set of analytical lenses and showed that their limitations arise from core architectural assumptions rather than optimization or data constraints. These limitations consistently pointed to the same underlying causes: forced sequential dependency, fixed-capacity memory, premature importance decisions, compressed representations, destructive memory access, and poor scalability to long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds directly on those insights. Instead of modifying recurrence or improving gating mechanisms, we explore an alternative architectural direction that removes the need for timestep-to-timestep dependency altogether. The goal is not to replace recurrence with a specific named model, but to derive a new class of sequence architectures that satisfy the architectural requirements identified by the lens-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by constructing a sequence model in which memory scales with input length, relevance is computed dynamically at usage time, interactions between sequence elements are content-based rather than position-based, and computation can be performed in parallel across all positions. Only after deriving these properties from first principles will we connect them to existing architectural realizations."
