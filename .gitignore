# Trained Model Artifacts (Excluded from Version Control)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These directories contain fully trained neural network checkpoints produced
# during controlled experiments. They are intentionally excluded to:
#   - avoid committing large binary files
#   - keep the repository lightweight and reproducible
#   - prevent coupling results to specific random seeds or hardware
#   - encourage retraining from code + configuration rather than weights
#
# Model families:
#   - GRU character-level name generators (names.txt)
#   - GRU character-level language models (Tiny Shakespeare)
#   - GRU subword-level language models (SentencePiece)
#   - Large-scale LSTM language model (Leviathan-LSTM)
